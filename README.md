# Professional README Generator

## Description

This is a program built with Node.js and npm inquirer. It generates a README file that follows the guidelines for a professional README based on input from the user via the terminal. This project was built to make it a little easier for developers to create their README files for their projects. It allows the developer to spend more time focusing on their project. While building this program, I learned a lot about how importing and exporting functions work as well as best ways to input the data the user types into the terminal. I think this really improved my JavaScript and Node.js skills!

## Installation

Install npm inquirer in order to run the prompts.

## Usage

Once the user has installed the appropriate packages, they will type "node index.js" into the terminal. This will cue the program to start and the prompts will appear one by one. Once the user has submitted all their responses, they should see a message in the terminal stating that their README was successfully generated. The generated file will have the name of "generatedREADME.md," which will be listed among the files in their current folder. The user can right click on the README file and "Open Preview" to see their generated professional README!
